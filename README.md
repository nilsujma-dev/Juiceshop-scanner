## OWASP Juice Shop Security Testing Script

This GitHub repository contains a Bash script designed for security testing of the OWASP Juice Shop, a deliberately insecure web application used for training and testing purposes. The script performs various types of attacks and exploits to demonstrate common security vulnerabilities in web applications.

### Script Features
1. **Injection Attacks**: Uses SQL injection techniques to manipulate the Juice Shop's product search API.
2. **Broken Authentication and Session Management**: Attempts to log in with random credentials and access user information.
3. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injects a script tag into the feedback API to test for XSS vulnerabilities.
4. **Insecure Direct Object References**: Tries to access BasketItems directly through their IDs.
5. **Security Misconfiguration**: Checks for publicly accessible `robots.txt`.
6. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Attempts to expose sensitive data like passwords during the login process.
7. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Simulates a CSRF attack by submitting feedback with a forged referer header.
8. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Tries to exploit known vulnerabilities in the Juice Shop's components.
9. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**: Tests the application's logging capabilities by making requests to the BasketItems API.
10. **Cleanup**: Removes the `cookie.txt` file generated during the testing.

### Usage Scenario
This script is intended for educational purposes, particularly for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and developers looking to understand and test for common web application vulnerabilities.

### Prerequisites
- Access to an instance of OWASP Juice Shop, typically running locally.
- A Bash shell environment to execute the script.
- `curl` installed for making HTTP requests.

### Security and Best Practices
- Use this script only in a safe, controlled environment, such as a local setup of the OWASP Juice Shop.
- Do not use this script against any web application without explicit permission, as it performs potentially harmful actions that simulate real attacks.
